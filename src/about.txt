Made for the "Bootlet Demake" TIGSource contest, on tigsource.com.

Run it on a PC, WinXP or Vista, with a rather recent 3D card.

During the install, u'll be prompted to deploy OpenAL. Please install it, unless you know you already have them, otherwise, the demo won't probably start.

The installer creates two shortcuts on the desktop, one using the full featured renderer (OpenGL 2.0), the other one using a more consusual rendering method, not as pretty but fairly ok.

Controls : use the arrow keys. Up = accelerate, Left & Right to strafe, Down = brake. The paddle is disabled.

Press ESC to quit the game.
